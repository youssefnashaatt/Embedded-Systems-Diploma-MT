Timer1 Module Driver for AVR
Driver is designed using interrupts with call back technique
Driver support both Normal(Overflow) and Compare mode.
Module Configuration:
- Create a structure in Main.
    Structure Members:
    1- Inital value.
    2- Compare value (Used only in compare mode)
    3- Prescaler
    4- Timer mode
- Fill structure members with the values needed in project.
- Pass the address of this structure as a parameter in Initialization function.



Driver's Functions:

1- Initialization and Start Function: void Timer1_init(const Timer1_ConfigType * Config_Ptr)
Functionality: Used in iniatializing Timer1 according to configurations setup in (Timer1_ConfigType pre-defined structure).

2- Stop Timer: void Timer1_deInit(void)
Functionality: Stop Timer counting and reset all configurations

3- Set Call Back Function: void Timer1_setCallBack(void(*a_ptr)(void))
Functionality: Set any desired function as call back function of the module, so it is directly executed whenever timer's interrupt occurred.

4- ISR(Timer1_Overflow mode)
5- ISR(Timer1_Compare mode)
Both ISRs are respnsible for directly calling the call back function defined and implemented by the user.
